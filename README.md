This is my last semester at EMU, I am a Computer Science Applied major and a Simulation, Animation, and Gaming minor. I have always wanted to be a game developer, but as I finish up schooling and the job market approaches I am being pushed more into normal software development, my specialization is in backend as well as UI programming. My preferred languages are C#, Java, and C++, but I am open to working in just about any language given the task. Outside of staring at a computer all day I like to travel and listen to music, I am always looking for new places and new music!
