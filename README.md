# Project-Ghost
A game about networking and web-based development.

# Team Policies
- If a Project-Ghost member cannot attend class or a scheduled meeting due to illness or emergency, the team will receive a message on the group Discord server as soon as the member realizes that they will be unable to attend. A team member will be considered absent if they arrive after more than half the duration of the meeting/class.
* If a Project-Ghost member cannot attend class or a scheduled meeting due to a major religious holiday, the team will receive a message on the group Discord server as soon as the member realizes that observing this particular holiday will coincide with a meeting/class. A team member will be considered absent if they arrive after more than half the duration of the meeting/class. Major religious holidays are defined as the holidays listed on the [Multi-Faith Calendar](https://hds.harvard.edu/community-life/religious-and-spiritual-life/multifaith-calendar).
+ It seems very rare that a Project-Ghost member would intentionally damage or destroy work. If this issue should arise, it should be dealt with based on the unique issues surrounding the situation. It is unlikely a flat policy could adequately handle such a complex situation.
- Ideally, teammates would discuss the code with the original authors.
If a teammate is unavailable or unresponsive, the code can be changed as needed, but the person whose code was changed will be made aware of the change and told why it needed to be changed.
Further, the author and all editors will be noted. Work within files is formatted, and methods/classes are commented on at the top, including who wrote/edited the method and a date to say when. The top of each file contains a comment block with info such as authors, dates, and a file description.

  Example: 

  `//Created by Name A 9/1, Edited by Name B 9/4`
- Project-Ghost members agree that English is the chosen language for our group and will be used at least 99% of the time.
- Project-Ghost members may wear a face mask if they wish to at any time, for any reason. Members must wear masks if the government/EMU mandates them to do so. Members are expected to wear a mask if they are experiencing something that may become an illness.

# Author
This game is maintained by Project-Ghost, which is made up of the tireless efforts of 4 exhausted students.

[Nate Campbell]() - I am Nate Campbell and I'm 24 years old. I will be graduating in the spring and I am a computer science major. I love learning new things and seeking out the latest in technology. I'm great at adapting to change and I'm looking forward to a great semester!

[Joy Poling](www.linkedin.com/in/joy-poling) - Hello, Iâ€™m a wife, mom, nurse, and student. I am very slowly working toward a bachelor's degree in computer science at EMU. I enjoy astronomy, electronics, DIY (or _tinkering_, as my husband calls it), knife throwing, sewing, lock sport, metal detecting, reading fiction, science, technology, and creativity in any medium. More and more these days, I find I prefer a nap over doing any of my hobbies.

Also, a special thanks to our instructor, [Siyuan Jiang](https://emunix.emich.edu/~sjiang1/).
