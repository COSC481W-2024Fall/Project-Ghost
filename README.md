# Project-Ghost
A game about networking and web-based development.

# Team Policies
- If a Project-Ghost member cannot attend class or a scheduled meeting due to illness or emergency, the team will receive a message on the group Discord server as soon as the member realizes that they will be unable to attend. A team member will be considered absent if they arrive after more than half the duration of the meeting/class.
* If a Project-Ghost member cannot attend class or a scheduled meeting due to a major religious holiday, the team will receive a message on the group Discord server as soon as the member realizes that observing this particular holiday will coincide with a meeting/class. A team member will be considered absent if they arrive after more than half the duration of the meeting/class. Major religious holidays are defined as the holidays listed on the [Multi-Faith Calendar](https://hds.harvard.edu/community-life/religious-and-spiritual-life/multifaith-calendar).
+ It seems very rare that a Project-Ghost member would intentionally damage or destroy work. If this issue should arise, it should be dealt with based on the unique issues surrounding the situation. It is unlikely a flat policy could adequately handle such a complex situation.
- How do we handle this when a team member changes another member's work in the repository? Please set up a guideline for anyone who may want to change another member's work in the repository.
- Project-Ghost members agree that English is the chosen language for our group and will be used at least 99% of the time.
- Project-Ghost members may wear a face mask if they wish to at any time, for any reason. Members must wear masks if the government/EMU mandates them to do so. Members are expected to wear a mask if they are experiencing something that may become an illness.

[Joy Poling](www.linkedin.com/in/joy-poling) - Hello, Iâ€™m a wife, mom, nurse, and student. I am very slowly working toward a bachelor's degree in computer science at EMU. I enjoy astronomy, electronics, DIY (or _tinkering_, as my husband calls it), knife throwing, sewing, lock sport, metal detecting, reading fiction, science, technology, and creativity in any medium. More and more these days, I find I prefer a nap over doing any of my hobbies.
